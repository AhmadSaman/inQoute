# Introduction

> A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly, And in many cases automatically

> Quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits, With same habits, you will end up with the same result But with better habits, anything is possible

> A long Series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress,-- the only choice I had --was to start small

> Four-Step model of habits --cue, craving response and reward-- and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps

> The framework that I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences

> Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn't change. it's about the fundamental of human behavior
